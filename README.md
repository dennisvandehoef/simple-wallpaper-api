# Simple Wallpaper API

This repository was quickly hacked together, using AI, to create a solution for changing wallpapers on smart home displays.

The main goal is to increase the WAF (Wife Approval Factor); therefore, I am currently focusing less on code quality and tests, which may be improved later.

At the moment, the solution relies on hard-coded images per month. With this application, I intend to show seasonally related pictures that also match the weather conditions of each day.
